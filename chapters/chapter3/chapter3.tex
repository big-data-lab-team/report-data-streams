\chapter{Extension of LTC to n Dimension And Implementation}
\label{chap:ltc-extension}
\TG{A transition with the previous chapter is really missing, here or in the conclusion
of the previous chapter. You also need to explain why you are doing this:
why do we need a multi-dimensional implementation, why you chose LTC, etc}

In this section we give the notation of LTC and provide a norm-independent
formulation of LTC in dimension $n$. By $n$ we refer to the dimension of the
data points $x_i$. To handle time, LTC actually operates in dimension $n+1$. And
we present how LTC n-dimensions is implemented. Our code is available at
