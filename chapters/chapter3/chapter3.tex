\chapter{Extension of LTC to n Dimension And Implementation}

\TG{A transition with the previous chapter is really missing, here or in theconclusion
of the previous chapter. You also need to explain why you are doing this:
why do we need a multi-dimensional implementation, why you chose LTC, etc}

In this section we provide a norm-independent formulation of LTC in dimension
$n$ and its implementation. By $n$ we refer to the dimension of the data points $x_i$. To handle time,
LTC actually operates in dimension $n+1$.
