\chapter{Extension of LTC to n Dimension And Implementation}

In this section we provide a norm-independent formulation of LTC in dimension
$n$. By $n$ we refer to the dimension of the data points $x_i$. To handle time,
LTC actually operates in dimension $n+1$. And we present how LTC n-dimensions
and Polynomial Regression is implemented.
