\chapter{Extension of LTC to Dimension n and Implementation}
\label{chap:ltc-extension}

In this section we introduce notations to describe \acrshort{ltc} formally, we
provide a norm-independent formulation of \acrshort{ltc} in dimension $n$,
and we describe its implementation.
By $n$ we refer
to the dimension of the data points $x_i$. To handle time, \acrshort{ltc}
actually operates in dimension $n+1$.
