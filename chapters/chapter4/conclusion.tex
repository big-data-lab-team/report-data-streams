\section{Conclusion}
This chapter demonstrated the effect of n-dimensional LTC. In the first section,
we compressed biceps curl, walking and running steam data in different
dimensions by using n-dimensional LTC. With error bound $\epsilon$=48.8\ mg,
3-dimensional LTC can compress at least 67\% of original data stream. For
walking and running data-sets, LTC with 3-dimension can help Neblina to save
energy up to 23.9\%, where the error bound $\epsilon$ = 48.8 mg. These
experiments and results show that n-dimensional LTC has good performance for
compressing stream data to reduce energy consumption of transmission in IoT
networks.
