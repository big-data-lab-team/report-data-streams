\section{Conclusion}
This chapter shows how is the effect of n-dimensional LTC. In the first section,
We compress biceps curl, walking and running steam data in different dimension
by using n-dimensional LTC. With error bound $\epsilon$ is 48.8 mg, LTC with
3-dimension compresses more than 67\% steam data. For walking and running
data-sets, LTC with 3-dimension can help Neblina to save energy up to 23.9\%,
where the error bound $\epsilon$ = 48.8 mg. Those above experiments and results
proves that n-dimensional LTC has good performance for compressing stream data
to reduce energy consumption of transmission in IoT networks.
