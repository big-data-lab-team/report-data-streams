In the experiments, we first evaluate the LTC n-dimension with biceps curls
data-set, and test the effect on energy consumption when it is used in Neblina.
Then we compare the compression ratio between LTC n-dimension and polynomial
regression compression method in different dimension. In order to restrict the
memory usage of LTC n-dimension for Euclidean norm, all the experiments in this
chapter define that the maximum number $L_s$ of n-balls saved in memory is 200.

The code and data-set used in experiments are provides on
