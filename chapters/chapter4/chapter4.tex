In the experiments, we first evaluate the LTC n-dimension with biceps curls
data-set, and test the effect on energy consumption when it is used in Neblina.
Then we compare the compression ratio between LTC n-dimension and polynomial
regression compression method in different dimension. The code and data-set used
in experiments are provides on

\TG{\#\#You should really provide a link to the code and data used in the experiments provided in this chapter, if not done already.}
