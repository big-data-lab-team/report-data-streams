\section{Stream summarization}

Stream data has became more and more important since the rist of the Internet of
Thing. Devices in IoT communicates with stream data. Stream data is transmitted
at high speed, and short intervals. Hardward also has limited small storage, so
stream data may never be reviewed if we did not process it immediately. Some
summarization technonic has been researched and proposed due to its volume and
velocity. We introduces several steam summarization techniques in this section.

\subsection{Overview of Stream Problems and Algorithms}
Most data stream analysis algorithms rely on data reduction and synopsis
construction techniques to compute approximate solutions that work with lim-ited
storage and time. We introduce some data reduction and sysnopsis construction
thechniques following:

\begin{itemize}
    \item  \textbf{Sampling} captures sub-sample of a data stream to represent
    data whole data stream and it could be used for extracting essential
    characteristics of a data stream~\cite{kejariwal2015real}.
    
    \item \textbf{Filtering} eliminate unuseful or unwanted data points from
    stream. We can only capture the data which we are intersted in. A sample
    example is filtering spam email.
    
    \item \textbf{Sliding windows} maintains a windows which moves with new data
    coming, it ensures the analysis and statistics using fresh data. It also 
    often uses for recording data in given bounded memory.

    \item \textbf{Estimating Cardinality}
    \todo{Frequency moments ?  or new \\item}
    
    
    \item \textbf{Clustering} separate all data points into different groups.
    Clustering is a techniques used in Mechine Learning. It could make the 
    similar points to cluster in one group. It makes sure that the points in one
    group as similar as possible, the points in different group as different as
    possible.For instance, they can be applied to problems such as the k-median 
    problem. 
    
    \item \textbf{Sketches}~\cite{alon1999space} summarizes data stream with 
    small amount memory. The sketch is usually used for specific queries over 
    data set.~\cite{kejariwal2015real}

\begin{comment}
    \item \textbf{Histograms} approximate the distribution of a set of values $v_1, ..., v_n$ by a piecewise constant function $\hat{v}(i),$ so as to minimize the sum of squared error. Equi-width histograms partition the domain into buckets such that the number of $v_i$ values falling into each bucket is uniform across all buckets. End-biased histograms maintain exact counts of items that occur with frequency above a threshold, and approximate the other counts by a uniform distribution~\cite{kejariwal2015real}.
    
    \item \textbf{Wavelet coefficients} are projections of the given signal (set of data values) onto an orthogonal set of basis vectors. The coefficients have the desirable property that the signal reconstructed from the top few wavelet coefficients best approximates the original signal in terms of the L2 norm~\cite{gilbert2002fast}. The choice of basis vectors determines the type of wavelets.
