\section{Conclusion}

% \TG{A transition with the previous chapter is really missing, here or in the conclusion
% of the previous chapter. You also need to explain why you are doing this:
% why do we need a multi-dimensional implementation, why you chose LTC, etc}

In this chapter, general lossless and lossy compression methods were presented.
The \acrshort{ltc} compression method fully meets our requirements because of
its low computational $\mathcal{O}(n)$ and space complexity $\mathcal{O}(1)$.
However, a problem is that \acrshort{ltc} compression method has only been
described for 1D streams, while streams acquired by connected objects, such as
acceleration or gyroscopic data, are often multi-dimensional~\cite{li2018multi}.
In the next chapter, we extend \acrshort{ltc} to dimension $n$ and give
implementation and a norm-independent expression of it. In
Chapter~\ref{chap:expsAndResults}, we test LTC n-dimension method on 3D
acceleration streams.
