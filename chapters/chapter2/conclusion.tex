\section{Conclusion}

\todo{add conclusion}
\TG{A transition with the previous chapter is really missing, here or in the conclusion
of the previous chapter. You also need to explain why you are doing this:
why do we need a multi-dimensional implementation, why you chose LTC, etc}

\BO{In our case, the Neblina has limited memory, and in order save more energy, we
prefer a compression method with low computational complexity so that decreasing
the energy cost of compression process. LTC takes O($n$) time and O(1) space for
compressing $n$ data points~\cite{schoellhammer2004lightweight}. Its good
compression ratio and very little energy cost fully meet our needs. So we will
mainly discuss LTC in Chapter~\ref{chap:ltc-extension} and
Chapter~\ref{chap:expsAndResults}.}
